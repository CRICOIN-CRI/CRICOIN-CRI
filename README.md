CRICOIN (CRI) - Cannabis Research Initiative Token 👋👋👋

VISION

CRICOIN - Cannabis Research Initiative.
It is the creation of a community around a token on the Etherium network that goes beyond simply funding research on cannabis and its medicinal uses. 
At CRICOIN, we want to make it very clear that we do not invite people to consume. What we advocate for is regulated use, supporting the fight for the regularization and legalization of cannabis.

CRICOIN is a project that does not have a centralized team or core; it will be 100% community-driven. 
We firmly believe in bringing together people who share certain values and viewpoints to create a strong and prosperous community focused on medicinal cannabis research and its recreational use.

The CRICOIN ecosystem starts with oneself. We are also working on regulatory frameworks to promote innovation, transparency, guarantees, and safety in the cannabis industry. 
We are actively seeking collaborations with organizations, institutions, and companies that share our vision and values 💞️. 
These partnerships will strengthen the CRICOIN network and increase its impact on the cannabis ecosystem and medical research.
